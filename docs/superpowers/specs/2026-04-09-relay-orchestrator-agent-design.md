# Relay Orchestrator Agent — Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-04-09
**Branch:** feat/turn-owned-mounted-relay-handoff
**Status:** Approved, ready for implementation planning

---

## Background

Current baton handoff workflow requires human operator to press hotkeys (a/d/e/space/h) to accept, defer, decline, amend, or hand back the turn. This is intentional for human-in-the-loop control but creates friction when the returning result still needs another implement/review pass.

This spec introduces a `RelayOrchestrator` daemon that automates only the post-handback judgment loop. It does not replace owner-side accept/defer/decline/handoff controls in mounted runtime. Instead, the orchestrator reads handoff records after each explicit `handed_back` event, determines whether the deliverable satisfies the request, and either closes the chain, triggers another loop, or escalates out of automation back to normal human-driven baton workflow.

## Architecture Overview

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   Broker (SQLite)                │
│  State machine: pending→accepted→handed_back     │
│  Emits: HandoffEvent stream                      │
└────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┘
                     │ HandoffEvent{handed_back}
                     ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          RelayOrchestrator (new daemon)          │
│                                                  │
│  1. Subscribe to broker handoff events           │
│  2. On handed_back → call LLM evaluator          │
│  3. Parse verdict: done | loop(N) | escalate     │
│  4. Write next action back to broker             │
└──────────┬─────────────────────┬────────────────┘
           │ loop                │ escalate
           ▼                     ▼
   broker.createLoopHandoff() broker.markEscalated()
   (create next round)        (surface to human operator)
```

**Key invariants:**
- Broker never calls LLM — stays pure state machine
- Orchestrator never writes SQLite directly — always via broker API
- Loop counter tracked per handoff chain (not per session)
- Escalation cap: configurable `maxRounds` (default 3)
- `orchestratorEnabled` is opt-in per collab — existing collabs unaffected
- Manual mounted-runtime controls remain source of truth before explicit handback

### Chain Identity And Persistence

Orchestrator decisions depend on durable chain state, not inferred in-memory state.

Each orchestrated handoff record must persist:

```ts
interface RelayHandoff {
  handoffId: string;
  chainId: string;              // stable for whole review/implement loop
  parentHandoffId: string | null;
  roundNumber: number;          // 1-based within chain
  rootRequestText: string;      // original request that started chain
  requestText: string;          // operator-visible task for this round
  handbackText: string | null;  // explicit returned payload captured at handback
}
```

Broker must also persist enough orchestrator bookkeeping to support restart-safe polling and idempotency:

```ts
interface RelayHandoffOrchestratorState {
  orchestratorStatus: "idle" | "pending" | "processed";
  orchestratorVerdict: "done" | "loop" | "escalate" | null;
  orchestratorReason: string | null;
  orchestratorEvaluatedAt: string | null;
}
```

Polling should target handed-back records whose `orchestratorStatus !== "processed"` rather than relying only on a process-local last-seen cursor.

---

## LLM Evaluator Contract

### Input

The orchestrator passes the handoff record to the LLM evaluator:

```ts
interface EvaluatorInput {
  rootRequestText: string;   // original request that started chain
  requestText: string;       // exact task sent in current round
  handbackText: string;      // explicit returned payload captured at handback
  senderAgent: string;       // who sent the baton for this round
  targetAgent: string;       // who did the work for this round
  roundNumber: number;       // current loop iteration (1-based)
  maxRounds: number;         // escalation cap
  captureStatus:             // how the handback payload was captured
    | "ok"                           // high-confidence capture, handbackText is reliable
    | "no_response_captured_confidently" // capture attempted but confidence check failed; handbackText is empty
    | "no_response_captured"         // capture produced nothing; handbackText is empty
    | null;                          // handback was manual (not via autonomous idle path)
}
```

### Model

`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` via Anthropic SDK. Chosen for low latency, low cost, and reliable structured output via tool use. Local model support (e.g., Ollama) deferred until cloud path is proven.

### System Prompt Role

Neutral judge — not Codex, not Claude. Reads request vs. response, determines if deliverable satisfies the request without bias toward either agent.

### Output

Structured JSON verdict:

```json
{
  "verdict": "done" | "loop" | "escalate",
  "confidence": 0.0–1.0,
  "reason": "short explanation",
  "followUpMessage": "injected into next handoff if loop"
}
```

`followUpMessage` is only present when `verdict === "loop"`.

It is reviewer guidance for next round, not a replacement for durable chain context.

### Decision Rules (baked into prompt)

| Condition | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Reviewer explicitly approves, or response fully satisfies request | `done` |
| Reviewer has findings, implementer needs another pass | `loop` |
| `captureStatus === "no_response_captured"` | `loop` (forced, skip LLM — re-issue task unchanged) |
| `captureStatus === "no_response_captured_confidently"` | `loop` (forced, skip LLM — re-issue task unchanged; prior partial output is not preserved) |
| `roundNumber >= maxRounds` | `escalate` (forced, overrides LLM) |
| Ambiguous or contradictory response | `escalate` |
| `confidence < 0.5` | `escalate` |
| LLM call fails after 1 retry | `escalate` (safe default) |

---

## Orchestrator Lifecycle

### Startup

Orchestrator starts alongside the relay, launched by broker daemon or `collab start` when `orchestratorEnabled=true` for the collab. Subscribes to broker handoff events on init via **polling** (broker is SQLite-backed, no native event emitter). Orchestrator polls for newly `handed_back` handoffs at a configurable interval (default 1s), filtering for records whose persisted orchestrator status is not yet `processed`.

### Per-Event Flow

```
handed_back event received
  → look up handoff record
  → check: orchestratorEnabled for this collab?
  → call LLM evaluator (async, non-blocking to broker)
  → on verdict:
       done      → broker.resolveChain(chainId)
       loop      → broker.createLoopHandoff(sender↔target swapped, composed follow-up request)
       escalate  → broker.markEscalated(handoffId, reason)
```

### New Broker API Methods

These methods do not exist today and must be added to the broker:

- `broker.resolveChain(chainId)` — marks chain as `done`, no further orchestrator action
- `broker.markEscalated(handoffId, reason)` — marks chain as `escalated`, stores verdict metadata, and disables further automatic looping for that chain
- `broker.createLoopHandoff(...)` — creates next handoff in same chain with incremented round metadata

### New Broker State Fields

```ts
// Added to RelayTurnState
orchestratorEnabled: boolean;
currentRound: number;
maxRounds: number;
chainStatus: "active" | "done" | "escalated";
```

`currentRound`, `maxRounds`, and `chainStatus` are read-model summaries. Source of truth for replay, restart, and auditing remains the durable handoff-chain metadata on broker records.

### Loop Message Composition

When verdict is `loop`, next handoff must preserve original task truth and current review feedback together.

The next round should persist:

- same `chainId`
- `parentHandoffId` = handed-back handoff that was just evaluated
- incremented `roundNumber`
- unchanged `rootRequestText`

The operator-visible `requestText` for the next round should be composed in this shape:

```text
Original request:
<rootRequestText>

Latest result:
<handbackText>

Follow-up:
<followUpMessage>
```

This keeps later rounds grounded in original request while still surfacing current reviewer guidance.

### Escalation Semantics

Escalation ends automatic looping. It does not require a new admin control plane.

By time orchestrator evaluates a record, explicit handback has already returned visible-session control to human baton workflow. Therefore `markEscalated(...)` should:

- mark chain as `escalated`
- persist machine-readable reason and verdict metadata
- surface escalation in `status` / `inspect`
- avoid creating any automatic next handoff
- leave collab in ordinary manual mounted-relay mode so humans can continue with normal visible-session controls if they choose

This keeps operator views read-only while avoiding a dead-end chain state.

### Failure Handling

| Failure | Behavior |
|---|---|
| LLM call fails | Retry once → if still fails → `escalate` |
| Orchestrator crashes | Broker state unchanged; human continues with normal manual baton flow |
| Collab ends mid-chain | Orphaned chain marked `done` on next broker cleanup |
| Two `handed_back` events fire rapidly | Idempotency guard on persisted orchestrator status prevents duplicate evaluation for same handoff |

---

## Dynamic Role Assignment

Roles (implementer vs. reviewer) are not fixed. They are determined by the handoff task:

- If Codex sends "review specs" → Codex is implementer, Claude is reviewer
- After Claude reviews → Claude may execute the spec plan, becoming implementer

The orchestrator does not need to track fixed reviewer/implementer identities. It reads `senderAgent`/`targetAgent` from each round record and swaps them on `loop`. The LLM evaluator may infer semantic role from request content, but broker-side routing still uses explicit recorded agents.

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit — LLM Evaluator

- Mock LLM responses, assert verdict parsing for each case
- Assert `followUpMessage` only present when `verdict === "loop"`
- Assert `escalate` forced when `roundNumber >= maxRounds` regardless of LLM output
- Assert `escalate` when `confidence < 0.5`

### Unit — Orchestrator Event Handler

- Mock broker API, feed synthetic `handed_back` events
- Assert correct broker method called per verdict
- Assert sender/target swapped on `loop` handoff creation
- Assert no action when `orchestratorEnabled=false`
- Assert duplicate polling cannot reprocess already-evaluated handoff
- Assert loop handoff preserves `chainId`, `parentHandoffId`, `roundNumber`, and `rootRequestText`

### Integration — Full Chain

- Spin up real broker + fake mounted sessions
- Orchestrator with mock LLM (returns controlled verdicts)
- Assert: `loop` verdict → new handoff created with correct agents/text
- Assert: `done` verdict → chain resolves, no new handoff
- Assert: escalation cap → `markEscalated` called after N rounds
- Assert: escalated chain remains visible in operator surfaces while manual relay can continue without special resume command

### Edge Cases

- LLM call fails mid-chain → `escalate` fallback fires
- Collab ends while orchestrator is evaluating → graceful no-op
- Two `handed_back` events fire rapidly → idempotency guard prevents duplicate evaluation
- `orchestratorEnabled=false` → orchestrator ignores all events for that collab
- Broker restarts mid-chain → polling resumes from durable handoff metadata without losing round identity

## Interaction With Mounted Relay

This spec builds on, and does not replace, mounted relay handoff behavior:

- accept / defer / decline remain explicit owner actions in mounted runtime
- handback remains explicit human action
- orchestrator begins only after explicit `handed_back`
- forced handback shortcuts remain mounted-runtime concern, not orchestrator concern

## Out of Scope

- Orchestrator accessing terminal output beyond the handoff record
- Orchestrator making decisions before `handed_back` (e.g., auto-accept)
- Fixed role assignments (implementer/reviewer always same agent)
- Multi-collab orchestration (one orchestrator per collab session)
- Local model support (Ollama, llama3, mistral) — deferred until cloud path proven
