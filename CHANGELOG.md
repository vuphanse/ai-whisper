# Changelog

All notable changes to the `ai-whisper` package are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- **Auto-handback no longer halts under lease contention.** When multiple
  mount processes share the host-global clipboard-capture lease (typical
  during cross-project autonomous work), the 4 s acquire window was too
  short to outlast a competing holder — `runLeasedCapture` would degrade
  to PTY-only without ever typing `/copy`, and the orchestrator received
  an empty handback and halted with `"No handbackText provided"` even
  though the reviewer had produced a substantive response. Raises the
  poll-acquire window to 30 s (TEMP marker in `mount-session-main.ts`),
  which absorbs typical contention while remaining invisible end-to-end
  (auto-handback already waits ≥30 s grace + provider idle). Proper fix
  per the capture-reliability hardening design is per-provider capture
  strategies (Phase 2); this is the operator-unblock bridge.

### Added

- **Capture-pipeline diagnostics in the mount stderr.** The auto-handback
  path in `mounted-turn-owned-relay.ts` was silently swallowing every
  failure (lease degrade, null short-circuit, unexpected exception),
  leaving operators with no signal beyond an empty `relay_capture_diagnostics`
  row. Adds `console.warn`s at every silent exit point — entry trace
  (`auto-handback fire: target=… handoff=… turnLen=… turnConf=…`), lease
  degrade (`/copy was NOT executed; PTY fallback only`), `captureHandbackText`
  null return (`likely no session claim`), and previously-swallowed
  exceptions (full error + stack). The first three lines now appear in
  the codex/claude mount terminal so the next halt is immediately
  diagnosable.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- **Status-first dashboard redesign.** `whisper collab dashboard` is rebuilt
  around a single colored glyph per card (`●` running, `⚠` stuck/halted, `✓`
  done, `✖` canceled, `◌` idle / manual relay) so state reads at a glance and
  the screaming `Chain active · ALIVE` text is gone. The Wall is now a grouped
  priority-fill grid with section headers and counts —
  **ACTIVE → IDLE/MANUAL → HALTED → DONE/CANCELED** — laid out in
  most-recently-kicked-off order within each group, with stuck-but-running
  workflows pinned to the front of ACTIVE so escalations stay loud. ACTIVE
  renders full 4-line cards (phase progress bar `▰▱`, per-agent health dots,
  two latest event rows); HALTED / DONE / CANCELED / IDLE collapse to compact
  2-line cards so the operator sees ~12 collabs at a time instead of ~3.
  ACTIVE is never dropped to make room for DONE — lower-priority groups only
  fill the leftover row budget — and the legend lives in the footer. The
  Inspector adopts the same visual language: status glyph in the header,
  terracotta-accented active tab, aligned/colored timeline + cost + evidence
  tables, and workflow-history rows prefixed by the same glyph map.
- **Shared `THEME` + `AGENT_COLOR` palette borrowed from ai-cortex.** A new
  `packages/cli/src/runtime/theme.ts` centralizes all dashboard colors —
  terracotta `#D97757` accent for brand / Inspector active tab,
  palette-green `#7FB069` for card selection (visually distinct from the red
  stuck / canceled border), plus `ok`/`warn`/`err`/`muted` tokens. Per-agent
  tokens render `claude` in signature terracotta and `codex` in palette teal
  `#5FB3C9`, replacing the legacy cyan/magenta in event lines. Card borders
  are now `single` style to match ai-cortex.
- **`whisper collab dashboard --window <duration>` flag.** Operator can widen
  or shrink the eligible-collab activity window from the command line without
  setting `AI_WHISPER_DASHBOARD_WINDOW_MS`. Accepts raw ms or human suffixes
  (`Ns`/`Nm`/`Nh`/`Nd`, decimals fine: `1.5h`) and the literal `all` (or
  `max` / `∞`) for unbounded — useful for inspecting historical or finished
  collabs that fell out of the default 30-minute window. Precedence: flag >
  env > default.

### Changed

- **Workflow type auto-abbreviates on narrow cards.** When a card's pane is
  below the 48-column threshold (e.g. a 2-column grid on an 80-col terminal),
  the dimmed workflow type renders as `bugfix` / `sdd` / `ralph` instead of
  the full `complex-bug-fixing` / `spec-driven-development` / `ralph-loop` to
  keep the header from truncating. Unknown types fall back to the first
  dash-segment, capped at 8 chars. Wide panes and the Inspector always show
  the full name.
- **Elapsed counter freezes on terminal cards.** A `done`/`canceled`/`halted`
  workflow's elapsed value is now computed against its `last_activity_at` end
  time instead of `now`, so the displayed duration reflects the run's actual
  length and stops ticking. Running workflows still advance normally.
- **`CollabSummary.workflowCreatedAt` is now projected.** A single additive
  nullable field on the broker's `CollabSummary` carries the bound workflow's
  `created_at`, so the Wall can sort collabs by kickoff recency. The
  eligible-collab query, finished backfill, and every other type/cast remain
  untouched.

### Fixed

- **`--window all` no longer crashes the dashboard.** `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`
  underflowed `Date.now() - sinceMs` below epoch and
  `new Date(<negative>).toISOString()` threw `RangeError: Invalid time value`.
  The eligible-collab cutoff is now clamped to ≥ 0, degenerating to
  `1970-01-01` for unbounded windows — exactly the "any collab with activity
  ever" semantic the operator asked for.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- **Operator pause / resume for running workflows.** A healthy, running workflow
  can now be frozen in place and continued later — without the escalation
  semantics of `halt`. This closes a concrete dogfooding failure mode: when a
  glitch in an artifact (spec/plan/source) steered both agents wrong, the
  operator's only options were to let the autonomous loop keep burning rounds on
  the bad artifact or `halt` it (which pollutes the review trail as "the system
  gave up"). New commands:
  - `whisper workflow pause <id>` — freeze a running workflow.
  - `whisper workflow resume <id> [--message "<note>"]` — continue it, optionally
    telling the agents what changed.

  `paused` is a first-class workflow status that **occupies the active-workflow
  slot** (the one-workflow-per-collab invariant and its partial unique index now
  count `running` **and** `paused`), so a second workflow cannot start during a
  pause. Pause freezes **all** delivery/orchestration drivers through a single
  broker chokepoint — a shared `isWorkflowDeliverySuspended` predicate gates the
  pending-orchestration list, claim, auto-accept, and the mount-side request
  injection — so a paused workflow delivers no new turn while a future driver
  inherits the gate by construction. The in-flight turn is never killed: its
  handback is still recorded so the loop can quiesce at a clean boundary, and the
  workspace snapshot baseline is captured **at that boundary** (via
  `git stash create`, scoped to tracked files excluding `.ai-whisper/`), not at
  the pause-command instant — so an in-flight agent's final writes are never
  misattributed to the operator. On resume, the agents receive a one-time notice
  listing the files the operator changed since the workflow quiesced plus the
  optional operator note, prepended exactly once to the next outgoing request
  (whether a handoff already pending accept or the next orchestrator-created
  loop handoff), requiring them to re-read and re-evaluate before continuing.
  Mid-workflow "pause the workflow" guidance — including the Codex-CLI Ctrl+C
  caveat — rides the canonical workflow handoff prompt and the bundled kickoff
  skills. The existing `halted → running` resume path is unchanged.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- **Stranded autonomous runs from duplicate active collabs.** A single workspace
  could accumulate more than one `active` collab; a workflow would then bind to
  one collab while the live mounted agents and the running daemon belonged to
  another, so its first handoff was created but never delivered or evaluated —
  the run hung forever at its first step while every operator surface
  (`status`, `inspect`, dashboard) reported "healthy". `ai-whisper` now enforces
  **one active collab per workspace** as an invariant: `mount` transparently
  re-adopts the existing active collab — including re-adopting one whose daemon
  has died, via `recover` — instead of creating a duplicate; a partial unique
  index makes the invariant impossible to violate from any code path; and a
  migration dedups any pre-existing duplicate active collabs (by survivor rules)
  before the index is created, re-run on every `applyMigrations`.
- **Clipboard capture race across concurrent collabs.** The relay captures an
  agent's handback by injecting `/copy` and reading the macOS system clipboard;
  with multiple collabs (or a human ⌘C) active on one host, a collab could read
  *another* collab's response and deliver it into the wrong workflow — worsened
  by the ≥100-char fast-path that trusts any substantial clipboard without a
  similarity check. A new **host-global capture lease** (a singleton row in the
  shared SQLite DB) now serializes every `/copy`→read window cross-process, so
  each read is provably this collab's own output. The lease reclaims stale
  holders (dead pid / TTL), releases on disconnect, and is swept on broker
  startup. `classifyCapture` and its load-bearing ≥100-char fast-path are
  unchanged — the lease removes the race that made the fast-path unsafe.

### Added

- **`changeCount` interference check** for the held capture window: snapshots
  `NSPasteboard.changeCount` before and after `/copy` (via a tiny `swiftc`-built
  native helper) to catch a human ⌘C that the lease cannot serialize. On
  interference it runs a bounded ladder — re-capture under the still-held lease
  → accept only on content similarity/identity (bypassing the ≥100-char
  fast-path) → degrade to the PTY turn text — and never blocks the turn. The
  helper degrades to a skipped check when unavailable (non-macOS or build
  failure), so capture still proceeds on the lease alone.
- `interference_detected` flag on relay capture diagnostics, recording when a
  foreign clipboard write was detected during a held capture window.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- **`complex-bug-fixing` workflow** — a third bundled workflow alongside
  `spec-driven-development` and `ralph-loop`. A fixed three-phase pipeline for a
  reported bug whose root cause is unknown: **diagnosis → fix-and-verify →
  post-mortem**.
  - **Diagnosis** is guarded by a dedicated adversarial review protocol
    (`WORKFLOW_DIAGNOSIS_PROTOCOL`): the implementer must reproduce the bug
    themselves (a committed RED test is strongly preferred — speculation from
    reading code is not a valid reproduction), and the reviewer independently
    reproduces it and keeps the gate shut until both agree the cause is proven
    and the fix is net-safe.
  - **Fix-and-verify** turns the reproduction GREEN and verifies across the
    declared blast radius under an acceptance review that also checks
    test-coverage adequacy.
  - **Post-mortem** records confirmed cause, fix, coverage gaps, residual risks,
    and lessons learned.
  - Diagnosis and post-mortem artifacts live in a gitignored per-run dir
    (`.ai-whisper/bugfix/<workflowId>/`) and are not committed — only the fix and
    the reproduction test land in the repo.
- **`/aiw-bugfix <path>` kickoff skill** — fire-and-forget wrapper that starts
  `complex-bug-fixing` on a bug report after a collab-readiness check, mirroring
  `/aiw-sdd` and `/aiw-ralph`.
- Documentation for the new workflow in `docs/workflows.md` (at-a-glance entry,
  "choosing the workflow", and an "authoring a bug report" guide) and an updated
  bundled-workflows list in `docs/evaluator-configuration.md`.

### Changed

- Engine: added an opt-in `PhaseConfig.anchorCommitBaseOnEntry` flag so a
  review-loop phase can anchor the commit base on entry. This lets the
  fix-and-verify acceptance review resolve `{commitRange}` as `base..HEAD`,
  spanning both the phase-1 RED reproduction test commit and the phase-2 fix
  commits. The change is strictly additive — `spec-driven-development` and
  `ralph-loop` commit-range resolution is unchanged, guarded by regression
  tests.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- `-v` / `--version` flag for the CLI, with a best-effort notice when a newer
  version is available.

### Changed

- Docs: README prerequisites, safety/permissions, and a "what happens if it
  fails" section; the two-agent non-goal codified in the concepts doc.
- Packaging: declare `engines.node >= 22` and add npm keywords.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- Dashboard: clear on wall↔inspector switch (no duplicated frames), keep
  recently finished workflows visible (floor of 3), and stop rendering done
  workflows as stuck.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- Caller-becomes-implementer role resolution and the workflows guide.

### Fixed

- Relay-handoff documentation correction.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- Ship `README`, `LICENSE`, and `NOTICE` inside the published package. They live
  at the repo root but the package publishes from `packages/cli`, so npm
  previously showed no README and the tarball carried no license; a build step
  now copies them into `packages/cli`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- Initial public release: terminal-first relay for paired AI coding agents
  (Claude + Codex) driven by structured workflows, with npm metadata
  (description, repository, homepage).
